# PayPal Payment Integration Migration

## Overview
Successfully migrated from Stripe to PayPal for payment processing to support India-specific requirements and better payment options.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Updates
- ✅ Removed: `stripe`, `@stripe/stripe-js`
- ✅ Added: `@paypal/paypal-server-sdk`, `@paypal/react-paypal-js`

### 2. New Files Created
- ✅ `src/lib/paypal.ts` - PayPal client configuration
- ✅ `src/app/api/paypal/create-order/route.ts` - PayPal order creation API
- ✅ `src/app/api/paypal/capture-order/route.ts` - PayPal order capture API

### 3. Code Changes
- ✅ Updated `src/action/verifyPayment.ts` - Complete rewrite to use PayPal API
- ✅ Updated `src/app/checkout/page.tsx` - Replaced Stripe with PayPal buttons
- ✅ Updated `src/app/checkout/pricingPlans.json` - Removed Stripe URLs
- ✅ Updated `src/app/postcheckout/PostcheckoutContent.tsx` - Added PayPal verification support

### 4. Environment Variables
Required environment variables (already configured):
```
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=AVwum4cqzS_dicZbWf6QMV92XHQ9g6WQkeUp1FTULLdXsK6Ke0702AgSVbIkV8pIfM63_FkVrVvYAoVE
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=EFiZyU-CW9mE_MGBY2-UeFK5ywvPe5BfdHtEBkTuy2o19MaITpRP1rYLAW_Qgi_3EC6clPcVpv_CNr
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=AVwum4cqzS_dicZbWf6QMV92XHQ9g6WQkeUp1FTULLdXsK6Ke0702AgSVbIkV8pIfM63_FkVrVvYAoVE
```

## Payment Flow

### New PayPal Flow
1. User selects a plan and goes to checkout
2. PayPal button is displayed with plan details
3. User clicks PayPal button → PayPal popup opens
4. User completes payment in PayPal
5. PayPal redirects back with orderID
6. Backend captures the order and verifies payment
7. User is redirected to success page
8. Database is updated with payment details

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/paypal/create-order` - Creates PayPal order
- `POST /api/paypal/capture-order` - Captures and verifies payment

## Benefits of PayPal
1. ✅ Better support for Indian customers
2. ✅ No need for external checkout URLs
3. ✅ Integrated payment experience
4. ✅ Support for PayPal accounts and credit cards
5. ✅ Better fraud protection
6. ✅ Familiar payment method for users

## Database Changes
The `userTable` now stores:
- `paypalOrderId` - PayPal order ID for reference
- `paymentStatus` - Payment status ('paid', 'pending', etc.)
- `amount` - Payment amount in cents
- `planType` - Selected plan type
- `paid_at` - Payment timestamp

## Testing
- ✅ PayPal Sandbox environment configured
- ✅ Test payments can be made with PayPal test accounts
- ✅ Order creation and capture working
- ✅ Database updates working
- ✅ Email notifications integrated

## Production Deployment
For production:
1. Update `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` and `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` with live credentials
2. Ensure `NODE_ENV=production` for live PayPal environment
3. Test with real PayPal account before going live

## Backward Compatibility
The system maintains backward compatibility with Stripe for existing payments:
- `verifyPayment()` function handles both PayPal orderID and Stripe session_id
- Postcheckout page supports both payment methods
- Database schema supports both payment systems

## Security Considerations
- ✅ PayPal credentials stored securely in environment variables
- ✅ Server-side payment verification
- ✅ Order capture happens on backend only
- ✅ No sensitive payment data stored in frontend

## Rollback Plan
If needed, the original Stripe implementation can be restored by:
1. Reinstalling Stripe packages
2. Reverting the modified files
3. Updating environment variables
4. Re-enabling Stripe checkout URLs
