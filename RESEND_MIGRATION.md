# Resend Email Integration Migration

## Overview
Successfully migrated from SendGrid to Resend for email services to support India-specific requirements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Updates
- ✅ Removed: `@sendgrid/mail`
- ✅ Added: `resend`

### 2. Code Changes
- ✅ Updated `src/action/sendEmail.ts` - Complete rewrite to use Resend API
- ✅ Updated `src/action/signup.ts` - Changed template ID for welcome emails
- ✅ Updated `src/app/(protected pages)/wait/page.tsx` - Updated template IDs

### 3. Email Templates
Created built-in HTML templates for:
- **welcome** - Welcome email for new users
- **payment_success** - Payment confirmation and processing notification
- **headshots_ready** - Notification when AI headshots are completed

### 4. Environment Variables
Required environment variables (already configured):
```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_YA4sbf1o_A4kbSfEHq4J39k9XanMNKida
NOREPLY_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
```

## Important Notes

### Scheduled Emails
⚠️ **Important**: Resend doesn't support scheduled email sending like SendGrid's `sendAt` parameter.

**Current Impact**: The scheduled "headshots ready" email (2-hour delay) is temporarily disabled.

**Solutions**:
1. **Immediate**: Send the completion email when the AI processing actually completes (recommended)
2. **Advanced**: Implement a queue system using:
   - Redis + Bull Queue
   - Vercel Cron Jobs
   - AWS SQS + Lambda
   - Database-based job queue

### Template Management
- Templates are now managed in code rather than external service
- Easier to customize and version control
- No external template dependencies

## Testing
A test script is available: `email-test.js`
```bash
node email-test.js
```

## Benefits of Resend
1. ✅ Better deliverability in India
2. ✅ Simpler API and pricing
3. ✅ Built-in template management
4. ✅ Better developer experience
5. ✅ No external template dependencies

## Next Steps
1. Test email functionality with real user signups
2. Implement proper completion email trigger when AI processing finishes
3. Consider implementing scheduled email system if needed
4. Monitor email deliverability and engagement

## Rollback Plan
If needed, the original SendGrid implementation can be restored by:
1. Reinstalling `@sendgrid/mail`
2. Reverting the changes in the three modified files
3. Updating environment variables
